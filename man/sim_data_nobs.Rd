\title{Simulate biased (via double-counting) point count and distance sampling data}
\usage{
sim_data_nobs(
  n_sites = 50,
  n_samps = 6,
  lambda = 10,
  det_prob = 0.42,
  gamma = 0.02,
  sigma = NA,
  W = 20
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_sites}{number of sites (transects)}

\item{n_samps}{number of samples (replicates) per site}

\item{lambda}{mean number of organisms per site}

\item{det_prob}{mean detection probability (det_prob = gamma + beta)}

\item{gamma}{probability of an organism being observed exactly TWICE}

\item{sigma}{detection parameter (meters). Just leave this blank and it will be calculated from det_prob}

\item{W}{transect half-width (meters)}
}
\value{
Returns a list of 4 items: 1. "true_N" is a matrix of true abundance values for each site (row) and sample (column). 2. "n_obs" is a matrix of the number of observed organisms at each site (row) and sample (column). 3. "y_list" is a list of vectors. Each vector holds the distance data for a single survey. 4. "inputs" is a list of input values.
}
\description{
Generate point counts and/or distance sampling data that is biased by double-counting.
Distance sampling data is created with each dataset, but it can just be ignored if you
only want the point count data. This is a rudementary function. Currently it
assumes constant density, detection probability, transects length, etc.
